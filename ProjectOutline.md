# Project Name: TaskTreats

## Project Overview:

TaskTreats is a lightweight Python app designed to incentivize productivity through a reward-based system. Users input their tasks, including estimated completion times, and earn rewards when tasks are completed.

## Objectives:

1. Increase user productivity and motivation by providing a reward system.
2. Encourage effective time management and task completion.
3. Develop an intuitive, user-friendly interface for task and reward management.

## Features:

- **Task Management:** Users can add, edit, delete, and view tasks, each with an estimated completion time.
- **Actual Time Tracking:** Users can input the actual time taken to complete each task when they mark it as completed.
- **Reward System:** TaskTreats assigns rewards based on the total time spent on completed tasks.
- **Data Visualization:** Users can view their task and reward data in various forms and for different time periods.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive, accessible interface for easy task and reward management.

## Data Models:

- **Task Model:** Includes task name, estimated completion time, actual completion time, and completion status.
- **Reward Model:** Includes reward name and its equivalent time value.
- **Data Visualization Model:** Includes parameters for different time periods and data forms.

## User Flow:

1. Users add tasks and their estimated times.
2. When marking tasks as completed, users input the actual time taken to complete each task.
3. TaskTreats calculates total time spent on completed tasks and assigns an appropriate reward.
4. Users can view their task and reward data in various forms and for different time periods.

## Design Considerations:

- The interface should be intuitive for users to add tasks and estimate times, as well as input the actual time taken upon completion.
- The reward system should be straightforward and transparent, clearly showing how rewards correlate with time spent on tasks.
- Data visualization should be simple but informative, providing insights on user's productivity and reward patterns over different time periods. Consider implementing charts or graphs for visualizing data over time.

## Project Timeline:

- **Week 1:** Design app layout and user interface. Start with a simple interface using prompts and ASCII art.
- **Week 2:** Implement task and reward models, actual time tracking feature and data visualization model. Integrate with the user interface. Start sourcing designs for the final GUI and artwork such as logos.
- **Week 3:** Code the reward assignment algorithm. Conduct initial testing with sample data.
- **Week 4:** Conduct user testing, gather feedback, and perform bug fixes. Prepare for app deployment.

## Technology Stack:

- Backend: Python
- Database: SQLite for local storage
- Version Control: Git, Github
- Deployment: Flask for a lightweight web server, suitable for both local testing and cloud deployment.

## Potential Challenges:

- Designing an engaging user interface.
- Implementing an effective reward system.
- Ensuring data consistency and handling edge cases.
- User engagement and retention over time.

## Success Evaluation:

- User engagement metrics (task completion rate, rewards earned, etc.) through analytics monitoring.
- Feedback and ratings from users.
- User retention rate.
- User story collection for future versions. 

## Next Steps:

- Conduct market research on similar productivity apps.
- Gather user feedback for feature improvements.
- Begin designing and prototyping the user interface.
- Set up the development environment and build the basic app structure.
- Design and implement the actual time tracking feature and data visualization model.
- Update the user interface to accommodate the new features.
- Test the app locally, then prepare for deployment on a cloud platform and eventual adaptation into a web-based mobile app.
